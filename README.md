# Arthexis Django Project

This repository contains a basic [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The default configuration uses SQLite and is for local development only.
To use PostgreSQL instead, set the `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable (and
optionally `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST` and
`POSTGRES_PORT`) before running management commands. If `POSTGRES_DB` is
defined, the project will connect to a PostgreSQL server using these
settings.

## VS Code

Launch configurations are provided in `.vscode/launch.json`:

1. **Run Django Server** – starts the site normally without the debugger.
2. **Debug Django Server** – runs the server with debugging enabled.

Open the *Run and Debug* pane in VS Code and choose the desired configuration.

## Maintaining Documentation

Documentation is split across multiple files. `README.base.md` provides the
overview while each app has its own `README.md` with app-specific details.
After updating any of these files, regenerate `README.md` with:

```bash
python manage.py build_readme
```

Avoid editing the combined `README.md` directly.


# Chat App

This project includes basic websocket support using [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/). After launching the development server you can connect a websocket client to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/echo/` and any text you send will be echoed back.


# Nodes App

The `nodes` app exposes a simple JSON interface for keeping track of other instances of this project:

- `POST /nodes/register/` with `hostname`, `address` and optional `port` will register or update the node.
- `GET /nodes/list/` returns all known nodes.
