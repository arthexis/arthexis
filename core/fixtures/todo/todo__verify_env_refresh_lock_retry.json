Run `sudo systemctl restart ${SERVICE}` and immediately start a read-only sqlite session against `db.sqlite3` (for example with `sqlite3 db.sqlite3 'BEGIN EXCLUSIVE;'`) to hold the lock.\n3. Watch `sudo journalctl -u ${SERVICE} -f` and `tail -f logs/startup.log` to confirm `scripts/prestart-refresh.sh` records the retry message `Database locked while loading`.\n4. Release the sqlite lock and confirm the prestart refresh finishes successfully and the service reaches the `active (running)` state.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for any Celery services if present.",
