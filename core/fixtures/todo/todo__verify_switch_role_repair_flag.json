Execute `./switch-role.sh --repair` from the deployment root and wait for the script to finish.\n4. Verify the script reports \"Repair completed for the Terminal role.\" and that locks/nginx_mode.lck has been restored to `internal`, locks/celery.lck has been recreated, and locks/auto_upgrade.lck still contains the expected channel.\n5. Open the Upgrade Report in the Django admin (System → Upgrade Report) and confirm no repair warnings appear and the auto-upgrade schedule loads successfully after the repair run.",
