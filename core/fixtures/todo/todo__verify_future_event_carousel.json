Visit the public Future Event Calculator at /awg/future-event/ and confirm only one timer is visible at a time while the others slide vertically into view.\n3. Use the Next and Previous controls to cycle through the events and verify the countdown values update to match each selection.\n4. Let the page sit for at least 30 seconds and confirm the carousel auto-advances when animations are enabled, then reload with the browser set to \"prefers reduced motion\" to ensure auto-advance pauses.\n5. Resize the browser below 576px (or use a mobile device) and verify the layout still shows one event at a time with readable text and working controls.",
