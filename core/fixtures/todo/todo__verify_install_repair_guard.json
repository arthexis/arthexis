Remove any existing guard units with `sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/${SERVICE}-upgrade-guard.*` (replace ${SERVICE}).\n3. Run `./install.sh --repair` and allow the script to finish successfully.\n4. Confirm `/etc/systemd/system/${SERVICE}-upgrade-guard.service` and `.timer` were recreated and that `sudo systemctl show ${SERVICE}-upgrade-guard.timer --property=ActiveState` returns ActiveState=inactive.\n5. Trigger the guard manually with `sudo systemctl start ${SERVICE}-upgrade-guard.timer`, wait a few seconds, and verify `systemctl list-timers --all` shows the timer counting down from five minutes.\n6. Cancel the timer with `sudo systemctl stop ${SERVICE}-upgrade-guard.timer` to avoid an unexpected restart.",
