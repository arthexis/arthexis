Trigger an upgrade with `./upgrade.sh --latest --no-restart` so the suite stops after migrations.\n3. Tail `logs/upgrade.sh.log` and ensure it no longer logs `Scheduled automatic restart via ...-upgrade-guard.timer`.\n4. While the upgrade finishes, run `systemctl list-timers --all | grep upgrade-guard` and confirm no guard timers are created.\n5. Allow systemd to bring the service back (it should restart automatically because the unit is configured with Restart=always) and confirm `systemctl status ${SERVICE}` reports `active`.\n6. Run `./status.sh` and verify it reports the service state without mentioning any upgrade guard timer and that the node is healthy. Record findings in the release notes if the OS-managed restart does not occur.",
