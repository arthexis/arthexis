From the deployment root, run `./install.sh --repair --service ${SERVICE}`.\n4. Watch the output for the \"Stopping\" messages and confirm no `database is locked` errors occur during migrations.\n5. After the script finishes, verify `systemctl is-active ${SERVICE}` returns `active` and any celery units are running again, confirming the repair restarted the stack successfully.",
