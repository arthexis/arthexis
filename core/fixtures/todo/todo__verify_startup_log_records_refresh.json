Restart the managed service with `sudo systemctl restart $(cat locks/service.lck)` (or trigger an auto-upgrade run) and wait for the unit to report `active`.\n4. Open `logs/startup.log` again and confirm a new `[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS] Running prestart environment refresh` entry was appended along with any env-refresh output.\n5.
