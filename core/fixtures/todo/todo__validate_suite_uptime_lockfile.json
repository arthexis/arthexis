After the service is healthy, open `locks/suite_uptime.lck` and confirm it contains JSON with a `started_at` timestamp that matches the restart time.\n3. Run `touch locks/suite_uptime.lck` to simulate the periodic heartbeat the uptime task performs.\n4. Visit System → Uptime Report in the Django admin and confirm the Suite uptime card shows a short uptime that matches the `started_at` value.\n5. Compare the displayed uptime to `python manage.py shell -c \"import core.system as s; print(s._suite_uptime())\"` to verify both sources use the lockfile rather than the host boot time.",
