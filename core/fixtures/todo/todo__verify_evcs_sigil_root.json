Use the Resolve Sigil tool to evaluate [EVCS.<station_pk>.CHARGER_ID] for a charge point that has no connector ID and confirm it resolves to the serial number.\n4. Repeat the lookup with a connector-specific record (connector ID populated) and verify the resolver leaves the token untouched, confirming connectors are excluded from the EVCS root.",
