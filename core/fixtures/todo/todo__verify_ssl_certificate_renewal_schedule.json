On the node, run 'sudo openssl x509 -noout -enddate -in /etc/letsencrypt/live/arthexis.com/fullchain.pem' and confirm the certificate expires more than 15 days in the future.\n2. Execute 'sudo ./renew-certs.sh' from the suite directory and confirm the script reports the skip message with 'Use --force to renew anyway.' while nginx is restarted if it was running.\n3. Re-run the helper with 'sudo ./renew-certs.sh --force' and confirm it proceeds with the renewal flow (nginx stops, certbot runs, nginx restarts).\n4. In Django admin, open the Celery periodic tasks list and verify the 'renew-ssl-certificate' entry is enabled with a schedule of 03:00 on the first day of each month.\n5. Inspect logs/renew-certs.log to ensure both executions were recorded.",
