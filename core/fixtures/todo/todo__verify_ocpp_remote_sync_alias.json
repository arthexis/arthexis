In a shell, run `python manage.py shell -c \"from ocpp.tasks import sync_remote_chargers; sync_remote_chargers.delay()\"` to enqueue the legacy task name used by the ocpp-remote-sync periodic schedule.\n3. Tail `journalctl -u celery-arthexis.service -n 100 -f` and confirm the worker logs `Task ocpp.tasks.sync_remote_chargers[...] succeeded` without any `Received unregistered task` errors.\n4. Wait for the `ocpp-remote-sync` periodic task to trigger (it runs every ten minutes) and confirm the log again shows a successful dispatch without errors.\n5. Open the forwarding dashboard and confirm forwarded charge points remain connected, indicating the alias still executes push_forwarded_charge_points.",
