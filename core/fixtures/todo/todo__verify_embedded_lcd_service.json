Reinstall with --systemd to manage the LCD via systemd.`\n3. Execute `systemctl list-unit-files | grep lcd-<service>` and verify no lcd-<service>.service units remain enabled when embedded mode is active.\n4. Run `ps aux | grep -F "python -m core.lcd_screen"` and confirm exactly one LCD updater process is running under the service account.\n5. Reinstall the node with `--systemd --lcd-screen` and ensure the lcd-<service>.service unit is recreated while the embedded process is no longer spawned during `./service-start.sh`.",
