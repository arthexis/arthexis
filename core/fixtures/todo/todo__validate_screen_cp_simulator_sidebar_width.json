With a desktop viewport (>=1200px), confirm the right-hand action column now spans roughly half of the simulator width so the Start/Stop buttons, status text, and JSON toggles are easy to read without cramped wrapping.\n3. Reduce the viewport below 1200px and verify the action column stacks below the form fields without overlapping content.\n4. Run a quick start/stop cycle to ensure the simulator controls still work and the status updates appear inside the wider column.",
