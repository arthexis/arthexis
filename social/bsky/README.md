# bsky

Integration with [Bluesky](https://bsky.app).

Users can register their Bluesky handle with an app password so the
project can publish posts on their behalf.  A domain-wide account may
also be configured using the `BSKY_HANDLE` and `BSKY_APP_PASSWORD`
settings to send posts from the site itself.
