# Agent Guidelines
- Note: do not modify README files unless directed. Use Django's admindocs for app documentation.
- Application documentation lives in Django's admindocs. Do not create or modify per-app README files.
- Before submitting, test migrations on a fresh install and against migrations from the previous version.
