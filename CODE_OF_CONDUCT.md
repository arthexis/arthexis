# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge
We pledge to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone
who participates in the Arthexis Constellation community—regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and graciously accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including project
documentation, issue trackers, pull requests, code reviews, and direct
communications tied to this project.

## Enforcement
