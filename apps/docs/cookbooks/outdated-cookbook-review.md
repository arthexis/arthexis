# Cookbook audit

Broken links in the cookbooks have been repaired to match the current `apps/` layout:

- **Favorites** now points to `apps/sites/templates/...` and `apps/locals/admin.py`. 
- **Node features** references `apps/nodes/admin.py`, `apps/nodes/feature_checks.py`, and `apps/nodes/models.py`. 
- **User data** links to `apps/locals/user_data/views.py` and the updated template locations. 

No cookbooks require deletion at this time.
